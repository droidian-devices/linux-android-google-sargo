config CPU_QUIET
	bool "CpuQuiet framework"
	help
	  Cpuquiet implements pluggable policies for forcing cpu cores into a
	  quiescent state. Appropriate policies will save power without hurting
	  performance.

config CPU_QUIET_STATS
	bool "per CPU statistics"
	default n
	help
	  Enable up/down count and total time plugged statistics per CPU. These
	  depend on correct driver input for reliability

	  If in doubt say N.

	default y
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  This governor will scale the number of CPUs online depending on
	  both CPU load and the number of runnable threads with careful
	  but simple and precise calculations.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

	  governor.

	  If unsure, say N.
